  abstract = {Though the truths of logic and pure mathematics are objective and
              independent of any contingent facts or laws of nature, our
              knowledge of these truths depends entirely on our knowledge of the
              laws of physics. Recent progress in the quantum theory of
              computation has provided practical instances of this, and forces us
              to abandon the classical view that computation, and hence
              mathematical proof, are purely logical notions independent of that
              of computation as a physical process. Henceforward, a proof must be
              regarded not as an abstract object or process but as a physical
              process, a species of computation, whose scope and reliability
              depend on our knowledge of the physics of the computer concerned.},
